# Autofastforward
Autofastforward is a minecraft plugin and GUI app that communicates with your router to let you more easily expose a internal router port (NAT) to the internet. It does this by communicating to the router through the UPnP protocol using the WaifUPnP library.

The goal and effect of this project is that it makes hosting a minecraft server much easier for beginners as they dont need to interface with their routers settings.
