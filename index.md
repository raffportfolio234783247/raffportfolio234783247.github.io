#  Hello there, I am Neal Shah. 
My main interest is computers and I spend most of my day with them.

some of the project's I've worked on are:

## Mercury Workshop
- [AnuraOS](/Anura) A browser-based environment focused on ABI stability which provides a desktop like experience without a backend.
- [Wisp](/wisp) A Layer 5 networking protocol designed for proxying TCP and UDP data efficiently via Websockets. Designed to work in the browser and the desktop for the Chinese Great Firewall.
- [sh1mmer](/sh1mmer) A chromeOS bootloader vulnerability turned into a repair shop toolkit.

## Radford University Collaborations
- [RCM](/RCM) A project aimed to create an affordable Cellular BTS for quick deployment in disadvantaged regions.

## Arkane Dev
- [WinPass11](/WinPass11) A tool which allowed you to upgrade to Windows 11 on incompatible hardware seemlessly.

## School projects
- [Anchor](/Anchor) A collaborative school project in which we created a Unity game with a warped perception of gravity. Players can choose any wall to walk on to complete puzzle-like 3D platformer stages.
- [Invaders from Space](/IfS) A game created by me and a friend inspired by the Japanese game series Touhou Project and Space Invaders. It won 1st place in Virginia State for the FBLA Computer Game and Programming category.

## Personal
- [reDNS](/reDNS) A miniature DNS over HTTPS client made in NodeJS which acted as a HTTP proxy server for other applications.
- [ttube](/ttube) A YouTube client written in Python which worked by rendering the video directly to your framebuffer, requiring no windowing system.
- [Autofastforward](/aff) A Java based UPnP client which operated either as a GUI or a Minecraft plugin. It automatically communicated with a user's router to expose a Minecraft server to the internet.
- [Denorine](/Denorine) A customizable self-hostable bot for a chatting platform called "Discord." It allowed users to install packages directly from the internet to enable for more functionality.
- [Better Chat Relay](/BCR) A Minecraft plugin which bridged a Minecraft chat to Discord. The plugin would parse users' Minecraft avatars as Discord profile pictures. When a image was sent in Discord, the plugin used a Minecraft "map item" with a custom texture to display the image to Minecraft players.
