# BetterChatRelay

BetterChatRelay is a small Minecraft plugin to relay Discord Chat messages to Discord and vice versa. Unlike other applications of the type, it used WebSockets to make it appear as actual discord users, providing a better expirience for integration. It also used a Minecraft map item to display images sent from discord.
