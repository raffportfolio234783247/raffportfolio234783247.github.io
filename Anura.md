# AnuraOS

[AnuraOS](https://beta.anura.pro/) is a browser-based environment which fully runs an Operating System (OS) inside of the users browser without a backend. It is sandboxed away from the system. This project is useful for distributing applications which work seemlessly no matter the system. Unlike a traditional VDI system, this is backendless making it much less expensive to run as you dont need anything more than a [WISP](wisp) network proxy to enable networking in the OS.
