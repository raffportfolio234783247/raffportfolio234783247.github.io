# WinPass11

WinPass11 was a critically acclaimed piece of software designed to modify the installer for Windows 11 to make it accept incompatible hardware. This allowed older systems to continue running modern software; therefore preventing the systems from ending up as e-waste.

Eventually, the software became obselete due to better options (like Rufus, a USB Install Media Creator) coming out, and WinPass11 was discontinued.
